Died: December 28, 2024

John Michael Thompson, beloved husband, father, and grandfather, passed away peacefully at his home in Springfield on December 28, 2024, at the age of 79, surrounded by his loving family.

Born in Chicago, Illinois, to Robert and Mary Thompson, John grew up in a close-knit family with his two sisters, Patricia and Susan. After graduating from Lincoln High School in 1963, he served honorably in the United States Army from 1964 to 1966.

Following his military service, John pursued his passion for engineering at Northwestern University, where he earned his Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering in 1970. It was during his college years that he met the love of his life, Margaret "Peggy" Wilson, at a campus dance. They were married on June 12, 1971, beginning a beautiful 53-year journey together.

John's career spanned over 40 years at Caterpillar Inc., where he began as a junior engineer and rose to become Chief Design Engineer. His innovative work on heavy machinery hydraulic systems earned him three patents and the respect of colleagues worldwide. He was known for his meticulous attention to detail and his mentorship of younger engineers.

John and Peggy raised three wonderful children: Michael (Sarah), Jennifer (David), and Robert (Lisa). He was immensely proud of his seven grandchildren: Emily, Thomas, Sarah, Jacob, Olivia, Benjamin, and Grace. Known as "Grandpa John," he delighted in teaching them about woodworking in his garage workshop and taking them fishing at Lake Springfield every summer.

A man of many talents, John was an accomplished woodworker who hand-crafted furniture for his entire family. His dining room table, made from oak he personally selected and milled, remains the centerpiece of family gatherings. He was also an avid gardener, known throughout the neighborhood for his prize-winning tomatoes and his willingness to share both produce and gardening advice.

John served his community faithfully as a volunteer firefighter for 25 years with the Springfield Fire Department, rising to the rank of Captain. He was also a longtime member of St. Mark's Lutheran Church, where he served on the building committee and helped construct the church's current fellowship hall.

John's legacy lives on through his family's memories of his gentle strength, his wise counsel, and his infectious laugh. He taught his children and grandchildren the value of hard work, integrity, and service to others. His workshop tools have been passed down to his sons and grandsons, ensuring his craftsmanship tradition continues.

Visitation will be held at Morrison Funeral Home on January 2, 2025, from 4:00 to 8:00 PM. Funeral services will be conducted at St. Mark's Lutheran Church on January 3, 2025, at 10:00 AM, with burial to follow at Springfield Memorial Cemetery.

In lieu of flowers, the family requests donations be made to the Springfield Fire Department Scholarship Fund or St. Mark's Lutheran Church Building Fund.
