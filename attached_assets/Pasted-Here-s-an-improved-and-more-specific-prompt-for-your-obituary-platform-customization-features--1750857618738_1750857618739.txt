**Final Spaces Memorial Page Customization Requirements**

I'm building a comprehensive obituary platform on Replit using Next.js and want to provide users with extensive visual customization options for their memorial pages. Here are the specific customization features I need:

**Layout & Element Management:**
- Drag-and-drop interface for rearranging all page elements (photos, text blocks, obituary content, tribute sections, etc.)
- Resizable elements with corner/edge handles - users should be able to resize photos, text boxes, and content blocks
- Grid-based or free-form positioning options
- Element layering controls (bring to front/send to back)
- Alignment tools (left, center, right, justify for text elements)
- Spacing controls between elements (padding/margins)

**Typography Customization:**
- Font family selection for different text types (headings, body text, dates, quotes, captions)
- Font size controls with slider or dropdown options
- Font weight options (light, regular, bold, extra bold)
- Text color picker for all text elements
- Text styling options (italic, underline, strikethrough)
- Line height and letter spacing adjustments
- Text shadow effects

**Visual Design Controls:**
- Background customization: solid colors, gradients, patterns, or uploaded images
- Color palette selector with pre-designed memorial-appropriate color schemes
- Opacity/transparency controls for background elements
- Border options for photos and text blocks (style, width, color, rounded corners)
- Shadow effects for elements (drop shadows, inner shadows)

**Obituary Integration Features:**
- If a linked obituary exists, make it a draggable/resizable element that displays:
  - Featured photo from the obituary
  - Truncated text preview (first 2-3 sentences)
  - "Read Full Obituary" link or expand option
  - Birth/death dates prominently displayed
- Option to style the obituary element differently from other page elements

**Photo & Media Enhancements:**
- Photo filters (sepia, black & white, vintage, soft focus)
- Photo border and frame options
- Slideshow/gallery creation from multiple photos
- Image cropping and positioning within frames
- Photo collage templates

**Interactive Preview System:**
- Real-time preview as users make changes
- Mobile/tablet/desktop responsive preview modes
- "Before/After" comparison toggle
- Save draft functionality
- Undo/redo capabilities

**Additional Customization Suggestions:**
- Memorial-specific design templates (elegant, modern, traditional, nature-themed, religious)
- Icon library for memorial symbols (crosses, flowers, doves, hearts, stars)
- Quote/scripture integration with special formatting
- Guest book styling and positioning options
- Memorial candle or flower animation effects
- Music/audio integration with custom player styling
- Timeline creation for life events with custom styling
- Memorial donation button customization
- Social sharing button styling and placement
- Weather widget for memorial service dates/locations
- Map integration for service locations with custom markers
- Memorial video embedding with custom player controls
- QR code generation for easy sharing (with styling options)
- Print-friendly layout options
- Anniversary date highlighting and special formatting
- Custom CSS injection for advanced users

**User Experience Considerations:**
- Intuitive toolbar with categorized options
- Keyboard shortcuts for common actions
- Template library with one-click application
- Save and share functionality
- Export options (PDF, image, print-ready formats)
- Collaborative editing if multiple family members need access

The goal is to make memorial page creation both deeply customizable and user-friendly, allowing families to create truly personalized tributes that reflect their loved one's personality and their family's preferences.
