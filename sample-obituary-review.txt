Margaret Rose Thompson Obituary

Margaret Rose Thompson, 84, of Riverside, California, passed away peacefully on January 10, 2025, at her home surrounded by her loving family after a courageous battle with Alzheimer's disease.

Born on May 15, 1940, in Portland, Oregon, Margaret was the daughter of William and Dorothy Johnson. She graduated from Lincoln High School in 1958 and earned her nursing degree from Oregon Health Sciences University in 1962.

Margaret dedicated 40 years of her life to nursing, working primarily in pediatric care at Children's Hospital of Orange County. She was known for her gentle touch, compassionate heart, and ability to comfort both children and their families during difficult times. Her colleagues remember her as a mentor who trained countless young nurses.

She married her high school sweetheart, Robert Thompson, on August 12, 1961. Together they built a beautiful life and raised four children: David, Linda, Patricia, and Steven. Margaret was also a cherished grandmother to nine grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.

Margaret had many passions outside of work. She was an avid gardener who could make anything bloom, a talented quilter whose creations are treasured family heirlooms, and a devoted volunteer at the local animal shelter for over 20 years. She also loved traveling with Robert, visiting all 50 states and several countries.

Margaret is preceded in death by her beloved husband Robert (2019) and her parents. She is survived by her children David (Carol), Linda Martinez (Carlos), Patricia Wilson (James), and Steven (Amy); grandchildren Michael, Jessica, Ryan, Ashley, Christopher, Emma, Noah, Isabella, and Sophia; great-grandchildren Lily, Mason, and Harper; and her sister Joyce Palmer.

A celebration of life will be held on January 18, 2025, at 11:00 AM at Riverside Community Center. The family welcomes all who knew Margaret to share memories and celebrate her remarkable life. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to the Alzheimer's Association or the Riverside Animal Shelter.

Margaret's legacy of love, service, and kindness will forever remain in the hearts of all who were blessed to know her.
